## What is Alabaster 2?

[Alabaster 2](https://github.com/NickolasHKraus/alabaster-2) is a fork of [hugo-alabaster-theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-alabaster-theme). [hugo-alabaster-theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-alabaster-theme) is a port of [alabaster](https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster). [alabaster](https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster) is a theme for the popular documentation tool [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). This theme port to Hugo theme is all about documentation. It should allow you to easily create documentation for your projects.

[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) and [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) are two examples of the original Alabaster Hugo theme in the wild.

The following pages ([Getting Started]({{< relref "01_getting-started/index.md" >}}) and [Adding Content]({{< relref "02_adding-content/index.md" >}})) will guide you through the basic mechanics of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and show you the capabilities of this theme. Have a look at the [Roadmap]({{ relref . "roadmap/index.md" }}) if you're curious about what comes next.
